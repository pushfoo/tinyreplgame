# TinyTextGameJS

You are probably looking for another library, such as [xterm.js](http://xtermjs.org/).

This is a learning project. It contains the following:

1. An enhanced subclass of [JavaScript's built-in Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) which adds a `choose()` method
2. A text-based console object which echoes any input
3. A playable example implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors using the two above

An older version is [live on neocities](https://pushfoo.neocities.org/20210220-rockpaperscissors/).

## Why did you write this?

1. To brush up on modern JavaScript features, such as modules
2. Demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript to prospective clients, teammates, & employers
